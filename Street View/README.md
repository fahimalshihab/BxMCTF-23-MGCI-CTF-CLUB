## Street View
Author: clides

One day, clides was doing some detective work to try to catch the person who stole the 2 rubber duckies from the BxMCTF prize pool. He was doing some OSINT and he stumbled upon this street view image from ClaudsVille on Dread. Apparently, this image was sent from the thief.

Can you help clides to find out where the image was taken?
